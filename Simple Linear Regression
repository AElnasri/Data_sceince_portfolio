Title: Applying Simple Linear Regression to Salary Dataset

Introduction:

In this project, I applied simple linear regression to a salary dataset to explore the relationship between years of experience and salary. The dataset contains 30 observations with two columns: Years of Experience and Salary. I utilized the linear regression model to analyze and visualize the relationship between these variables.

Dataset:

The dataset used for this analysis can be accessed from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/iamravi1/salary-data/input
Methodology:

   1. Data Preparation: I started by loading the dataset and exploring its structure and summary statistics to gain insights into the data.
   2. Data Visualization: Next, I created visualizations such as scatter plots to visualize the relationship between years of experience and salary.
   3. Train-Test Split: Before building the linear regression model, I split the dataset into training and testing sets. This allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.
   4. Linear Regression Model: Using the lm() function in R, I fitted a simple linear regression model to predict salary based on years of experience.
   5. Model Analysis: I analyzed the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand the relationship between the predictor and the response variable. 
   Additionally, I evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE.

Results:

The linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between years of experience and salary. 
The coefficient of the predictor variable (years of experience) was found to be 9152.3 , indicating that, on average, for each additional year of experience, the salary increased by 9152.3 units.

The model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7686.788, suggesting that the model's predictions were 7686.788.
Conclusion:

In conclusion, the simple linear regression analysis provided insights into the relationship between years of experience and salary. 
The results suggest that years of experience have a significant impact on salary, with higher experience generally associated with higher salaries. 
This analysis can be valuable for organizations in making decisions related to employee compensation and career growth.
